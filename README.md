# template-for-PS
a template I shall use for PS competitions (when I am allowed to do so)

* Aim: leaves less space for memory-related mistakes
* Aim: easy to use (once you know what data structures the classes implement)
* Aim: flexible
* Aim: Practice c++17 features

## TODO

* Support for operations on Z_p
* Implement some boilerplates (like findAll(std::string from, std::string to) )
* Make a bunch of segtrees
  * ~~Vanilla~~
  * With lazyprop
  * ~~Persistent~~
* Make a `bigint` class
* Make a `bigbigint` class
* Make some templates for using STL (priority_queue)
* ~~A documentation...?~~
